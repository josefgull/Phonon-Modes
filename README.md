# Phonon Modes — Motion of Crystal Lattice Atoms

## Acoustic Modes
![Acoustic Phonons](./phonon_acoustic.gif)

All crystal atoms lie on planes. The displacement \(D\) in transversal modes is:

$$
D(x, t) = A \, \sin(k x - \omega t)
$$

Where:
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $k$ is the wave number (inverse of spatial wavelength)
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (inverse of temporal period)

As \(k\) increases, the wavelength can become comparable to or smaller than the spacing between atomic planes.  
In this regime, the discrete lattice cannot fully resolve the wave, and the oscillation appears visually “folded” or aliased.

## Optical Phonons

Neighboring atoms oscillate **out of phase**.  
Neighboring atoms move out of phase, producing a high-frequency internal vibration with little net displacement of the lattice.

Optical modes typically occur in lattices with **more than one atom per unit cell**, and differ from acoustic modes due to the **phase alternation between neighbors**.
